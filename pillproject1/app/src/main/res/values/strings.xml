	                <ul><P>• How much paracetamol you can take depends on your age, your weight, the type of paracetamol you\'re taking and how strong it is.</P>
	                <p>• Adults can usually take one or two 500&nbsp;mg tablets every 4–6&nbsp;hours, but shouldn\'t take more than 4&nbsp;g (eight 500&nbsp;mg tablets) in the space of 24&nbsp;hours.</p>
	                <P>• Be careful not to use other medications that contain paracetamol as an ingredient (such as some cold and flu remedies) while you\'re taking paracetamol.</P></ul>
