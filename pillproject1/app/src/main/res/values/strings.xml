    <string name="about2">Notes on paracetamol from the NHS website:
                            \nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on your age, your weight, the type of paracetamol you\'re taking and how strong it is.
                            \nAdults can usually take one or two 500mg tablets every 4-6 hours, but shouldn\'t take more than 4g (eight 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours.
                            \nBe careful not to use other medications that contain paracetamol as an ingredient (such as some cold and flu remedies) while you\'re taking paracetamol.</string>
